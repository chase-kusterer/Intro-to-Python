    "It’s summer and we all know that that means: It’s time to learn Python! This amazing language was first developed in 1989 and was designed to be simple so that everyone can code. After being founded in the Netherlands, it quickly spread across the world to become one of the most popular languages of today. In fact, millions of programmers are using it for a wide variety of tasks. Some are developing platforms like Instagram and Netflix, while others are having fun making their own video games. Although Python shares the same birthday as Taylor Swift, it is much more famous. Did you know it was even named after a famous TV show?!"
