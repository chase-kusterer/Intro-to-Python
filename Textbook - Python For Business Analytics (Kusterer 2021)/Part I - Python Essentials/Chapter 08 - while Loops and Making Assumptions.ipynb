    "As mentioned in <strong>Chapter 7: for Loops and Basic Data Manipulation</strong>, a <strong>while loop</strong> can be thought of as an extension of a conditional statement. More specifically, a <strong>while loop</strong> is like a hybrid between a conditional statement and a for loop. They are similar to for loops in the sense that they iterate. Similar to conditional statements, as long as the condition(s) specified is met, a <strong>while loop</strong> will continue running. This powerful coding structure is incredibly useful, as it enables programmers to accomplish a wide array of tasks. For example, they can be used to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* take a list of all the students in a cohort and break them into teams of four\n",
    "* allow a user to reenter their password if their first attempt was invalid\n",
    "* calculate how many NBA seasons it took for Michael Jordan to score 25,000 points\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In addition to the fundamentals of <strong>while loops</strong>, this chapter will also cover some syntax that is also useful in other coding structures, namely for loops and user-defined functions (covered in the next chapter). For example, in many situations a programmer needs to <strong>break</strong> out of the body of a loop before an iteration has finished. At other times, it may be necessary to skip over an item in an iterable and <strong>continue</strong> the loop by iterating on the next item. As you may have guessed, the syntaxes that enable such functionality are <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#break-and-continue-statements-and-else-clauses-on-loops\">break</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#break-and-continue-statements-and-else-clauses-on-loops\">continue</a>. Both are essential in building a solid foundation in Python.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<strong>Note:</strong> As mentioned, <strong>while loops</strong> will run until a specified condition is no longer met. If we are not careful, we may get stuck in a loop that does not stop running. Before moving forward, you may want to go back to <strong>Chapter 1: Setting Up for Success</strong> to refresh on what to do in such a situation. As an example, notice the difference between <em>Codes 8.0.1</em> and <em>8.0.2</em>. Without the final line in the body of the <strong>while loop</strong>, the loop's condition is always met and the code runs on into infinity (<em>Code 8.0.2</em>). <strong>Make sure you understand how to interrupt your kernel before running this code!</strong>\n",

    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, <strong>while loops</strong> can be utilized to accomplish tasks such as taking a list of all the students in a cohort and breaking them into teams of four. To exemplify this, let's assume our cohort had a total of eight students, as in <em>Code 8.1.1</em>. Let's also assume that teams need to be random and that no student is allowed to be on more than one team. In order to accomplish our task, we need to develop a code that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* randomly selects a student and puts them on a team\n",
    "* removes the student from the selection pool so that they do not end up on more than one team (sampling without replacement)\n",
    "* fills each team to exactly four members\n",
    "* keeps iterating until every student has been placed on a team\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by importing the random package so that we can utilize the method <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#functions-for-sequences\">choice</a> in our code. This method is designed to randomly choose one element from a population. Given our requirements, a drawback to using this method is that it samples with replacement, meaning there is a chance that a student will be selected more than once."

   },
   "source": [
    "Unfortunately, there is no optional argument in <strong>random.choice</strong> that enables sampling without replacement. However, the problem of selecting a student more than once can be avoided through a clever design of our code. What if, after a student is selected in an iteration of our loop, they were removed from the <em>students</em> list? This way, there would be no chance of the same student being selected in the next iteration of the loop, as the student would no longer be available for selection. This can be achieved by applying the <strong>.remove()</strong> method on <em>students</em>.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Also note that at first, the condition of the <strong>while loop</strong> may seem unclear. Essentially, this condition is telling Python to keep looping as long as there is something to iterate over in <em>students</em>. In fact, the syntax:\n",

    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "while len(students) > 0:\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Both syntaxes will achieve the same result, although the first is much more common. Also, note that once the loop has iterated over every item in <em>students</em>, the condition that there is still something left to iterate over evaluates to <em>False</em> and the loop stops running.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Finally, each time <em>Code 8.1.1</em> is run, different teams are created. This does not violate any of the requirements for our task, but it makes it difficult to replicate our results. If our goal was to avoid this, we could employ the use of <strong>random.seed()</strong>, as explained in <strong>Chapter 4: Numbers, Comparisons, and Randomness</strong>."

    "* This calculation should be made as the total number of seasons between Jordan's first and the one in which he surpassed 25,000 points.\n",
    "* Jordan choose not to play basketball in the '93-'94 season even though he was capable of doing so.\n",
    "* Even though Jordan retired, he came back from retirement. Therefore, those seasons should be counted.\n",

    "The value of an analysis stretches far beyond the sciences, and in many cases, it is much more of an art. Given this, each analysis requires substantial thought regarding the problem at hand, and such considerations lead to various assumptions that make each analytical perspective unique. Without documentation, it is incredibly difficult to understand an analyst's thought process. Moreover, it becomes challenging to trust the findings and actionable insights that resulted from such work. Assumptions need to be documented, whether embedded within scripts, in a document or project management tool, or even in a notebook that you keep next to you while you are working. Although this takes time up front, it will save you countless hours in the long run, especially when working with other analysts or reviewing an analysis that you conducted several months ago.\n",

    "<h4>Developing our Solution</h4>\n",
    "In order to calculate how many seasons it took for Jordan to score more than 25,000 points, we first need to develop a method to iterate over total points in each list of <em>jordan_stats_2</em>. This can be accomplished with the use of a for loop, as covered in <strong>Chapter 7 - for Loops and Basic Data Manipulation</strong>. Our goal is to stop iteration after accumulating a certain number of total points, and for this we have multiple options. More specifically, we may choose to fit out the body of the for loop with either a conditional statement or a <strong>while loop</strong>, as both could solve this task. Since conditional statements were already covered in <strong>Chapter 6 - Conditional Statements and Controlling Input</strong>, we will build a solution using this method first. <em>Code 8.4.2</em> has been left open for this task. Make sure to:\n",

    "* iterate over <em>jordan_stats</em>\n",
    "* stop iteration after accumulating at least 25,000 points\n",
    "* use a conditional statement inside the body of a for loop (don't use a <strong>while loop</strong>)\n",

The solution utilizing the <strong>while loop</strong>, however, uses less lines of code. Additionally, this solution appears to be easier to extend if there was a change in our requirements. For example, let's assume that it was decided that points should only be accumulated in seasons where Jordan led the league in scoring.

From 1967-1976, two nationally-scoped basketball leagues existed in the United States (the National Basketball Association and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Basketball_Association\">American Basketball Association</a>). Thus, each season played within these years has two scoring leaders. If our code was designed to allow only one scoring leader per season, it may throw an error. We may also run into a situation where a player was traded and thus has two records for a given season. This may prove to be a challenge when calculating how many seasons the player took to attain a certain number of points.
