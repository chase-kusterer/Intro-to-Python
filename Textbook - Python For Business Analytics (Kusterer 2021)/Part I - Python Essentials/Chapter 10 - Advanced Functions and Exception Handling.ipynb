    "<h2>10.1 Functions with Variable Arguments</h2>\n",
    "Recall from  <strong>Chapter 1: Learn This Before Learning Else</strong> that <em>*args</em> and <em>**kwargs</em> allow for arguments of varying length. In other words, these syntaxes are very useful when there is need to allow flexibility in the amount of inputs a user can specify. A good example of such a need is a shopping list. To keep things simple, let's assume that the requirements for our <em>shopping_list</em> function are to take items as arguments and then print them out one-by-one. Also, common knowledge implies that different users will have shopping lists of different lengths. Therefore, it would be very challenging if users were forced to make their lists of a certain length. For example, if our function was designed as follows:\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "def shopping_list(item_1, item_2, item_3):\n",
    "    print(f\"\"\"\n",
    "Shopping List:\n",
    "    * {item_1}\n",
    "    * {item_2}\n",
    "    * {item_3}\n",
    "    \"\"\")\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "users would be required to have shopping lists that consist of exactly three items. Otherwise, the function will throw an error. A remedy to allow users more flexibility would be to make all of the arguments optional, setting their default values to <em>None</em>. Using this approach, users would be able to input as many items as they like, up to the amount of optional arguments that exist in the function. Additionally, the number of optional arguments could be increased to allow for longer lists. Although this approach solves the need for more flexibility, the function's body becomes unnecessarily long and inefficient:\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "def shopping_list(item_1=None, item_2=None, item_3=None):\n",

However, as we know from <a href=\"https://github.com/chase-kusterer/Python-for-Business-Analytics\">Chapter 3: User Input and Variable Types</a>, errors can also be caused by user input. To help manage this, Python includes two useful syntaxes: <strong>try</strong> and <strong>except</strong>. As their names suggest, <strong>try</strong> permits a program to <em>try</em> to do something, and <strong>except</strong> is used to instruct Python on what to do in the event that the program throws an <em>exception</em> after trying.

As you may recall, this code was designed to calculate how many seasons it took for Michael Jordan to score 25,000 points. Our original approach threw exceptions when encountering strings in the points per season data (Index\\[1] in each sublist). Thus, one of our first steps was to clean the data so that points per season only contained integers. This was a good approach, but it is limited. To illustrate, let's assume an overnight change was made to our data source and all data within had been converted to strings. In such a case, the data cleaning process conducted in <strong>Chapter 8: while Loops and Making Assumptions</strong> would result in all data being removed due to its type. A more sound approach would be to <strong>try</strong> to convert each string into an integer and tally successful attempts accordingly. This would also allow for the possibility of calculating how many seasons were skipped due to Jordan not playing. <em>Code 10.4.4</em> has been left open for you to:\n",

    "User-defined functions have a wide array of tools that allow for flexibility and stability. Understanding these tools not only helps in developing functions that achieve their intended purpose, but also in utilizing functions from packages and code snippets found online. The scope of a variable affects where it can be accessed, and syntax such as <strong>global</strong> and <strong>nonlocal</strong> can be used to adjust scope (although they can have unintended consequences). The <strong>try</strong>/<strong>except</strong> structure can be implemented to handle exceptions and is a great approach to stabilizing codes that require user input.\n",
