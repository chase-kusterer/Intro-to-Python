    "Conditional statements such as those starting with <strong>if</strong> are an excellent starting point for controlling the flow of a code. Such statements have been appropriately termed <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html\">control flow tools</a>. This chapter will expand on such tools with a syntax known as <strong>for loops</strong>. <strong>Loops</strong> are a powerful coding structure that allow programmers to <strong>iterate</strong>. In other words, loops allow us to run a code over several items stored in an object without the need to implicitly write code for each run. If this isn't making sense just yet, think of loops as a faster/more advanced alternative to copy/pasting. We will solidify our understanding as we move forward through this chapter.\n",

    "Loops come in two forms: <strong>for loops</strong> and <strong>while loops</strong>. The former is used to iterate over an iterator (strings, lists, arrays, columns of data, etc.). Without more detailed instruction, <strong>for loops</strong> will run until they have completely iterated over every item in an object. For example, if we have five items in a list, a basic <strong>for loop</strong> will iterate over all five items one at a time. As with conditional statements covered in <strong>Chapter 6: Conditional Statements and Controlling Input</strong>, loops operate on a boolean pretense (True/False). For example, if you run a <strong>for loop</strong> on a list, the loop will run until it is <em>False</em> that there are still items in the list to iterate over. Just like with conditional statements, if a condition is <em>False</em>, Python will move on to the next line of code formatted at Column 0. An example of a <strong>for loop</strong> is displayed in <em>Code 7.1.1</em>.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "A <strong>while loop</strong> can be thought of as an extension of a conditional statement. As long as the given condition is true, a <strong>while loop</strong> will continue to iterate.

    "Essentially, the <strong>for loop</strong> in <em>Code 7.7.1</em> starts by operating on the first item of <em>lst</em>, printing its value. When it has completed this task, it moves on to the second item and performs the same operation. This continues until the contents of the loop have run on all elements in <em>lst</em>. Afterwards, the <strong>for loop</strong> realizes that <em>lst</em> no longer has any items to iterate over and stops running (i.e., it runs until it is <em>False</em> that there are still items in the list to iterate over).\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "The anatomy of a <strong>for loop</strong> (<em>Figure 7.1</em>) is very similar to the anatomy of a conditional statement. The first line of a loop starts with a syntax identifying which type of loop is being coded (in this case, a <strong>for loop</strong>), and ends with a semicolon ( : ). In between these two pieces of syntax is a phrase that tells Python what object to look into and what to iterate over. In other words:\n",

    "It makes no difference what you name the <em>THINGS_TO_ITERATE</em> component (also known as an iteration object). This is just an object name of your choosing. In <em>Code 7.2.2</em>, <em>random_name</em> has been used instead of <em>element</em>. More formal coders like to use the letter <em>i</em>. The key is to make sure that you do not use an object name that already exists in your code as this may cause conflict. Once an iteration object has been named, it will exist in your Python environment and will store the value of the last iteration of it's respective loop. In the case of the loop in <em>Code 7.2.2</em>, the last iteration from <em>lst</em> was the letter <em>'e'</em>. This can be observed from printing the contents of <em>random_name</em>, as in <em>Code 7.2.3</em>. Again, <strong>it makes no difference what you name your iteration object</strong>. This being stated, it is in your best interest to name it something that helps you remember what your loop is supposed to do. <em>Code 7.2.4</em> is an open coding block designed for you to be able experience the fact that it does not matter what the iteration object has been named.\n",

    "<strong>Hard coding</strong> is the process of writing code that contains static syntax (i.e., using <em>hard</em> numbers instead of objects). It may not make a huge difference in the snippet above, but it can create several frustrations in larger codes. For example, let's imagine we were using the imputed value of price (<em> price = 100 </em>) in more than one place in our code. If it was later decided that missing prices should be imputed at a value of 200, we would need to be very careful to ensure that we update every <em>price = 100</em> throughout our script. Additionally, this change may take a long time to code, test, and debug.\n",
