In general, <a href=\"https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source\">open source</a> projects are community-driven, publicly available, and free of charge. More often than not, our analytical endeavors will rely on open source packages such as <a href=\"https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/index.html\">numpy</a>, <a href=\"https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/\">pandas</a>, <a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html\">scikit-learn</a>, <a href=\"https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html\">statsmodels</a>, <a href=\"https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/contents.html\">matplotlib</a>, <a href=\"https://seaborn.pydata.org/\">seaborn</a>, and many others depending on our task at hand.

This will not only help in utilizing publicly-available resources to their fullest extent, but will also help in identifying when a developer may have cut corners. Every so often, a package is released that contains functions that are unstable or that only work in a limited context. Generally, such packages can be identified by the quality of their documentation. The content of this chapter emcompasses these aspects, as well as best practices when naming functions, variable scope, and common error types.\n",

    "<h4>The Limited World of a Function</h4>\n",
    "It is important to understand why <strong>return</strong> statements are required to get something back from a function. To get there, think of your working environment as the entire planet on which all of your code lives. We will call this the <strong>global environment</strong>. Also, think of declaring an object as creating an living being on your planet, and this being is free to interact with other objects in the global environment. If another object is declared with the same name, it will cause conflict and the former object will be overwritten.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Now, think of the body of a function as its own island where its inhabitants have been secluded for so many generations that they are completely oblivious to anything that exists elsewhere. This is good because these objects have no way to adversely affect the global environment (i.e., overwriting objects). This island is the function's environment. Oftentimes, we need something from the function's environment to interact with the global environment, and as the master of both environments, we have the ability to make this happen. In other words, at times we need something from the island to <strong>return</strong> to the global environment, and the syntax to accomplish this is, not surprisingly, named <strong>return</strong>.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "A <strong>return</strong> statement has been added to <em>Code 9.2.2</em>, where the <em>square()</em> function is returning the results of a calculation. More commonly, such results are first stored within an object in the body of a function and the object is returned. This is occurring in <em>Code 9.2.3</em>, where the calculation results have been stored in the object <em>val</em>, which is referenced in the <strong>return</strong> statement. Both codes give the same result.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Note that even though <em>val</em> was returned in <em>Code 9.2.3</em>, it is not actually available as an object in the global environment. This is Python's way of protecting the function's users from accidentally overwriting object names. In other words, if the global environment already contained an object named <em>val</em>, it would be protected from being overwritten. On the same token, any object in the global environment that shares the same name as an object in a function's environment will not be overwritten when the function is called, even if it contains a <strong>return</strong> statement. There is one exception to this rule, which will be covered later in this chapter. The results of <em>Code 9.2.4</em> confirm that <em>val</em> has not been defined globally.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<h4>Storing Function Output</h4>\n",
    "A common method for storing the returned output of a function is to declare it as an object in the global environment. The type of the declared object depends on what was returned from the function. In <em>Code 9.2.5</em>, since the <em>square()</em> function returned an integer, the object <em>' y '</em> is of this type.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Also note that once Python executes a <strong>return</strong> statement, it leaves the body of the function, even if another <strong>return</strong> statement is on the next line. However, a <strong>return</strong> statement can reference more than one thing (separated by commas). By default, a function will return a <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences\">tuple</a> if more than one object referenced in a <strong>return</strong> statement (<em>Code 9.2.6</em>). <strong>Tuples</strong> are very similar to lists, but are represented with curved brackets and are immutable (they cannot be changed). <strong>Tuples</strong> are very important in functional programming, but are beyond the scope of our current coding needs. For now, it is important to understand that indexing a <strong>tuple</strong> is no different than indexing a list.\n",

    "A good approach to writing functions is to use as few mandatory arguments as is reasonably feasible. This approach has a number of benefits, such as making a function easier to use and reducing the chance of errors due to an invalid argument input. Oftentimes, however, you will have the need to develop additional features so that your function can be used in a wider array of applications or to allow users a certain level of customization. Such situations call for the use of <strong>optional arguments</strong>, or arguments that have a set default value. To illustrate, let's modify <em>Code 9.2.3</em> so that it takes any number to any power."

    "This modification can be accomplished by defining a second argument in the first line of the function, which has been done in <em>Code 9.3.1</em>. The second argument, <em>power</em>, has been made optional with a default value of two. When selecting the default value for an optional argument, it is a good practice to consider what users will commonly input if the argument was mandatory. Considering our original function was designed to square a number, defaulting <em>power</em> with a value of two seems appropriate.\n",

    "Default values in optional arguments can be overridden by declaring a new <strong>parameter</strong> when the function is called.

In fact, most of Python's help files have a section labeled <em>Parameters</em> that explains what each argument does and indicates what types of inputs are acceptable.\n",

In other words, their purpose is to help users understand what something does and how it should be used. They are a key component of many coding structures in Python, including functions, classes, modules, and packages, although we will only be discussing them in terms of functions in this chapter.

    "User-defined functions are a powerful tool that allow programmers to blueprint code so that it can be used over and over again. Defining a function is similar to writing a conditional statement or a loop in that the first line starts with a designated syntax and ends with a semicolon. Also, the body of a function must be indented. Arguments can be specified when defining a function, and can be mandatory (no default value), optional (contains default value), or variable (varies in length). All functions should contain docstrings, regardless of how simple they may be. Docstrings should explain what a function is intended to do, list and explain parameters, and give usage examples.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "A variable's scope can have unexpected consequences on other objects. Nested functions require one to pay particular attention to the scope of each variable, which can be managed with the use of <strong>return</strong> statements and scoping syntax such as <strong>global</strong> and <strong>nonlocal</strong>. Scoping syntax should be used with extreme caution as it may adversely affect a user's code. Also, function names should be unique as to not unintentionally overwrite an existing function.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Finally, comprehending how to write, document, test, and exception handle user-defined functions will greatly increase your ability to benefit from functions available in the open source community. When researching packages available in the open-source community, the quality of a package's documentation can indicate whether or not the package is stable and/or will work as intended. When encountering a package that is not documented well, it may be wise to search for an alternative tool.\n",
