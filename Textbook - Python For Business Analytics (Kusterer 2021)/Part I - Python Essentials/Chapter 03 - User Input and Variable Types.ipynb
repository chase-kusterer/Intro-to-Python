    "<h3>Common Object Types</h3>\n",
    "There are an ever-growing number of object types in Python. This is because Python programmers have an ever-growing number of needs. For example and as a preview of what's to come, the data science package <em>pandas</em> is home to the <em>DataFrame</em> object type, which is Python's version of a spreadsheet. Looking further out, when instantiating a model object in the machine learning package <em>scikit-learn</em>, each model object is of its own type. The rationale behind having so many different object types is that it allows each object to behave the way its programmer intended. You can think of an object type like a template, or even better, a tool to perform a specific task. Some tools are flexible and can perform a diverse set of tasks, while others were designed to solve a very limited number of needs. This is another great example as to why you should read the documentation. The <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/datatypes.html\">documentation on data types</a> can be bewildering for first-time coders, but it contains a wealth of information as to what each object is designed to do, as well as useful methods to help you use each type to its fullest extent."

    "<em>Code 3.3.1</em> meets its requirements, assuming a user input their age as instructed by the <strong>input()</strong> prompt. However, the code can be improved. In particular, it does not take advantage of string calculations, and has several <strong>int()</strong> type conversions spread throughout the code when just one could be used to achieve the same result. Also, the format of the output looks as if it could be improved. The output for <em>days</em> looks appropriate, as depending on the user's input, it displays trailing decimal places (according to \n",
    "<a href=\"https://pumas.jpl.nasa.gov/examples/index.php?id=46\"> NASA</a>, a year is approximately 365.25 days long).<br><br>\n",
    "However, the results for hours, minutes, and seconds are showing a trailing zero. We can clean this up by implementing an <strong>int()</strong> wrapper around each calculation within the curly brackets in our <strong>print()</strong> statement. To keep our code consistent, we should also put a wrapper around the calculation for <em>days</em>, even though it is already functioning properly. This is to help avoid unknown errors, and to also help inform other coders of our intended output.<br><br>\n",
    "Such enhancements have been made in <em>Code 3.3.2</em>. As can be observed, the <em>age</em> object is being converted into an integer immediately after it is defined. Notice how this object does not need to be converted back into a string in the line of code reading <em>Happy birthday you beautiful...</em> . Python is doing this for us behind the scenes of the <strong>print()</strong> statement. Design decisions such as this one help make Python a truly remarkable language.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Also in <em>Code 3.3.2</em>, the star borders of the birthday message have been recoded using string calculations. Also notice the enhanced functionality of the exclamation point in the birthday message. With this addition, the message will print one exclamation point for every year since the user's birth. Finally, the conversions to days, hours, minutes, and seconds have been wrapped with their appropriate type conversion wrappers.<br><br>\n",
    "There are many ways to further enhance our code. For example, if a user were to input data of type string, float, or boolean in the <strong>input()</strong> prompt instead of an integer, <em>Code 3.3.2</em> would throw a <em>Value Error</em>. It is important to control for such errors, which is a concept known as <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html\">exception handling</a>. However, we will save this conversation for a later point in our coding journey."
