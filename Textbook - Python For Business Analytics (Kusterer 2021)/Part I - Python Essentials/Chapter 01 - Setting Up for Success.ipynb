It is an interesting read and makes some very good points. However, even though Python may be easy to learn, <strong>it is important to learn how to learn Python, and that is the purpose of this chapter.</strong> At times, you will get stuck, and you need to know what to do. There will also be many times when your code won't run properly, even when you've spent hours trying to debug it. This is very frustrating, and it is something all coders experience from time to time. The good news is that as long as you are not one of the world's most advanced Python coders, someone has already experienced and solved your problem. More importantly, it is very likely that a solution to your problem has been generously shared to the open source community. All you need to know is where to find it. Not knowing can be devastating to your morale. To exemplify this, the following story is from one of my former students, which took place while conducting an analysis for the course: Machine Learning.<br><br>\n",

A great example of this is the Game of Thrones Character Prediction analysis project.<br>\n",

I spent countless hours working on the dataset: engineering new features, testing out different machine learning algorithms, and trying not to question my life choices too deeply. On the note of life choices, coincidentally, the campus café was looking to hire a new manager and they asked me if I would like the position. I have to be very sincere, after the lack of sleep, the stress of hours of trying to debug my code to no avail, and the process of trying to build an algorithm that predicts reasonably well, the option of giving up and living a more chill life sounded very appealing.<br>\n",

    "<h4>Line 1 - Built-in functions</h4>\n",
    "Python comes with a set of default, or <strong>built-in functions</strong>. These are also referred to as <strong>primitives</strong>, and are functions that are so important, they are available without the need to import additional packages (for an example of a package import, see <em>Code 1.1.3</em> where we import the package <em>pandas</em>). At the time of this writing, the most recent version of Python (<em>version 3.7.3</em>) has 69 built-in functions, which can be found in <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html\">the Python documentation on Built-In Functions</a>. Python also comes with a series of other built-ins. For example, <em>built-in types</em>. According <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html\">to the Python documentation on Built-In Types</a>, principal built-in types include numerics, sequences, mappings, classes, instances and exceptions. Think of built-ins as the primary numbers of Python: every function can be broken down into these built-ins. Also, keep in mind that Python was designed to be used for a wide variety of programming tasks, and what is commonly used for business analytics is just one small subset. To avoid information overload, this book will primarily focus on the built-ins, functions, methods, and packages that are most relevant to our purposes. If you're not sure what a function, method, or package is, don't worry. We will go into these details in later chapters.\n",

    "The steps throughout <em>Figures 1.2a through 1.2d</em> are using a technique called <strong>chaining</strong>, or linking multiple Python syntax together using a dot (i.e. a \".\"), to explore part of the <em>pandas</em> package. According to its <a href=\"https://pandas.pydata.org/\">documentation from  pydata.org</a> <em>pandas</em> is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language. It is a very powerful package for business analytics, and it is a very large. Anaconda has kindly included it in their Python 3 installation, and all we need to do is <strong>import</strong> it.\n",

    "<h2>1.4 Talking to Humans through Comments</h2>\n",
    "Notice how in <em>Code 1.4.3</em> we replaced the longer hashtag comments with triple-quote strings. This is a way to provide comments to humans on multiple lines in a more readable way. Technically speaking, Python will recognize these as lines of code and then try to run them. However, since there is no <em>print()</em> wrapper around these statements and they are not assigned to objects, Python has no use for them and immediately forgets that they exist. In other words, since Python has not been instructed to do anything with the triple-quoted statements, it ignores them. Finally, notice also that we added parentheses around each of the triple quotes. This is a good practice as it helps to organize our code and helps to prevent unwanted errors.<br><br>\n",
    "<em>Note:</em> There may be a time when someone reviewing your code tells you that using stand-alone strings (i.e. strings that aren't part of an object or a <em>print()</em> statement) to make comments is a bad practice. There is some rationale to this. Since Python runs stand-alone strings, it may take a tiny bit longer to process when compared to hashtag comments. In the real world, however, there are much larger technical bottlenecks, and I have yet to see a situation where things were so optimized that commenting style was the biggest processing obstacle affecting a code. For now, if you feel that your code is better communicated with stand-alone strings, use them.  Different companies will have different guidelines for commenting, and it is best that you follow a style that you are comfortable with while learning.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "In business analytics, the purpose of most projects is to gain actionable insights and make recommendations. This takes a thorough and thoughtful exploration of the data, as well as constant communication with stakeholders to truly understand the problem you are trying to solve. <strong>One of your goals will be to communicate as clearly as possible.</strong> If this is best done by using stand-alone strings, use them.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<em>Code 1.4.4(a)</em> and <em>Code 1.4.4(b)</em> demonstrate the additional processing time from the use of stand-alone strings. As can be observed, the use of stand-alone strings had a very minor, if any, impact on the processing time of our code.<br><br>\n",
