    "Up to this point, we have covered several fundamental coding principles. Now, we are ready to dive into more advanced structures, starting with techniques to conditionally control a code's output. In short, we are ready to discuss conditional statements. A <strong>conditional statement</strong> (also known as a conditional) is a coding syntax that runs if a given condition is met. Conditional statements are very common in the real world. Take, for example, the following statement:\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "If it's raining, the baseball game will be canceled.\n",
    "Otherwise, the game will take place as scheduled.\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "As generally in the real world, Python conditional statements start with the word <em>if</em>. The syntax for the alternative statement (<em>'otherwise'</em> in the example above), is <em>else</em>. In the case of the statement above, if it is not raining, the condition to cancel the game is not met and the thus it is disregarded. This is better exemplified in the following expansion of our baseball example:\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "If it's raining, the baseball game will be canceled and we will email all of the people\n",
    "that bought tickets. We also have to issue refunds, and will do so by directly\n",
    "crediting people's credit cards. Since some people paid in cash, we will provide them\n",
    "with a cash voucher in the email that can be redeemed within the next 90 days. Also,\n",
    "since some people may have traveled a long distance to attend the game, we need to make\n",
    "sure to remind them that our Terms and Conditions state that we are not responsible for reimbursing travel expenses. Finally, we should inform our call center that they may\n",
    "receive a high call volume given the situation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, the game will take place as scheduled.\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Compared to the first example, the second takes longer to read and process. It would be incredibly inefficient if we were required to read and process all instructions for every conceivable situation every time there was a baseball game, especially if the conditions for each instruction were not met. Python feels the same way, and takes a similar, pragmatic approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>A Note to Excel Users</h4>\n",

    "One of the most powerful syntaxes to address our challenge of making <em>Code 6.3.2</em> more user friendly is the two letter word <strong>in</strong>. This syntax checks to see if a certain element exists inside a larger set of elements.

In other words, it allows us to check if a character or set of characters exists in a string.

    "A conditional statement is a coding syntax that runs if a given condition is met. They are very common in many programming languages, and in Python are structured as follows:\n",

    "Conditionals can be extended with the use of <strong>elif</strong> and <strong>else</strong>, and several conditionals can be combined with the use of <strong>and</strong> / <strong>or</strong>. Remember, indenting is very important, as it tells Python what code it is required to run and what code it can skip if a given condition is not met.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Finally, case methods such as <strong>.capitalize()</strong>, <strong>.casefold()</strong>, <strong>.lower()</strong>, and <strong>.upper()</strong> can help limit the amount of conditionals needed to control user input as well as in other situations where strings are being utilized.
