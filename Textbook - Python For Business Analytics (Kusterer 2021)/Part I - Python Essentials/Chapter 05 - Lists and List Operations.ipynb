    "<h2>5.1 Why Lists are Important</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Having learned the basics of indexes in the previous chapter, we are ready to understand the value of declaring lists. For our purposes:<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\"><h3>\n",
    "    Lists are a way to better organize information.\n",
    "<a class=\"tocSkip\"></a></h3></div><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal with lists is to store more than one item in the same place. You can think of this as declaring one object that holds many things. Conceptually, lists are the simplest of Python's four built-in data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets), and are something that you must be comfortable with before conducting data analysis. They are used very frequently, and your time spent understanding them will pay dividends on your ability to grasp more advanced concepts.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<h4>A special note for Excel users:</h4>\n",
    "If you're used to working with Excel sheets, also known as flat files, please note that these exist in Python as well. We call these DataFrames, and they are housed in the <strong>pandas</strong> package. You may be wondering:<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\"><em>\"Why do I need to learn about lists if I can use a data structure that I'm more familiar with?\"</em></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "This mentality held me back when I was first learning to code. I was used to my data being structured in a spreadsheet and expected it to always be this way. It also didn't help that in most cases, data science competitions provided data in a spreadsheet or something that could easily be converted into one. I did not fully understand the value of other data structures until I started to work on real projects. In the real world, data comes in <em>many</em> formats, and in today's world of analytics, you will be expected to do much more than work with flat files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key lesson to keep in mind is that <strong>coding involves a different type of thinking than working with software such as Excel</strong>. You will not regret the time invested in learning how to work with different data structures.<br><br>\n",

We will explain the rationale for this when we discuss <strong>for loops</strong> in a later chapter.\n",

Classes help to ensure that objects behave the way that they are supposed to so that programmers don't get unexpected results. More information on classes can be found in <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/classes.html\">the official Python documentation</a>.<br><br>\n",

To exemplify this, see <em>Code 5.2.4</em>. Even though both objects contain the value 5, we do not get the same result when applying simple numerical operands such as multiplication. Again,<br><br>\n",
