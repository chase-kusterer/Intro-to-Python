    "<h2>11.1 Domain Knowledge Gathering in Business Analytics</h2><br>\n",
    "Previous chapters were designed to explain critical programming concepts in Python. Before moving forward, it is important to note that concepts such as lists, conditional statements, loops, and user-defined functions exist in virtually every modern programming language, making the knowledge attained up to this point transversal across a variety of tasks involving code. Additionally, now that you have an understanding of the fundamentals, it is feasible to branch out into any number of specializations using Python. For example, if you are interested in another field of programming such as web development, you are now able to pursue such an endeavor. In fact, at the time of this writing, <a href=\"https://www.netsolutions.com/insights/top-10-python-frameworks-for-web-development-in-2019/\">Google, Netflix, and Instagram are all using Python for their web development efforts</a>.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "As you (hopefully) expected, the remaining chapters of this book will focus on applying Python to business analytics. <strong>Business analytics is a deep subject</strong>, and a number of analytical philosophies have emerged to try to keep pace with its rapid expansion. The analytical philosophy of this book is centered around a very simple concept:\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<div align=\"center\"><strong>\n",
    "    Business analytics is about applying information to solve problems.\n",
    "    </strong><a class=\"tocSkip\"></a></div><br>\n",
    "It is my hope that you feel this is one of the most intuitive concepts ever written. In the opinion of your author, however, an incredible amount of analytical solutions fail to adequately focus on solving their respective problem, let alone even meet the performance of approaches based on experience and/or common sense. This failure is largely due to analysts sitting too far away from the problem they are trying to solve, many with little to no interest in doing anything more than rushing to build a predictive model. Such analysts lack the discipline required to avoid cutting corners, especially in terms of acquiring enough <strong>domain knowledge</strong> to develop a proper solution. Instead, they fall deep into a model metrics rabbit hole, losing site of everything except for a model's predictive performance.<br><br>\n",
    "Although this chapter is intended to introduce critical aspects of DataFrames, it is important to keep in mind that if working on an analytical project in a business setting, domain knowledge gathering would be a continual process that should not be neglected. As each new DataFrame method is introduced throughout this chapter, take a moment to consider as to how it can be utilized in tandem with domain knowledge in order to develop an analytical solution.\n",

    "If you decided to skip reading the documentation above, go back and do so now. Remember, business analytics is about applying information to solve problems. Solving problems is incredibly challenging without domain knowledge, which encompasses documentation on datasets. A common entry-level mistake is to skip such knowledge gathering and jump right into the data. Such an approach is equivalent to putting on a blindfold and attempting to drive a car: you are actively choosing to ignore important information, making you less capable in what you are trying to achieve.\n",

    "Once again, DataFrames allow row-wise elements to be of different data types. However, data types for the elements of each column must be the same. This is important to remember, as Python follows a <a href=https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#the-standard-type-hierarchy>built-in hierarchy</a> when column-wise data types are inconsistent. For example, if a string were present in the <em>carat</em> column, Python would convert every element in this column to a string, even if every other element was a float. At this point in your Python journey, understanding the built-in hierarchy in detail is not necessary. For now, just know that when a column's data type is different than expected, it is likely that the column in question contains anomalies (unexpected strings, missing values, etc.). Such anomalies will be addressed in a later chapter.\n",

    "<strong>Conditional subsetting</strong>, or filtering a DataFrame based on a set of conditions, can be accomplished using square brackets. At first, this can be a bit confusing, as filters are often used in tandem with lists, which also use square brackets. A good approach is to remember that Python does not care about spacing, and use this to your advantage.\n",

    "Now let's add some flavor to our subsetting by relating diamond engagement ring prices to per capita income. Recall from <a href=\"./__documents/miller_mds_two_months_salary_case.pdf\">the documentation</a> that the diamond data was collected in the city of Chicago in 2007. Per capita income for the city of Chicago is available on <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/\">the U.S. Census Bureau website</a> and the most relevant income data we can gather within an arm's reach is collected from 2014-2018. Although this does not perfectly align with the data collection period, it is a reasonable place to start, and the U.S. Census Bureau comes from a globally-respectable source. Also remember that if we soft code, we can update the per capita income as new information becomes available.\n",

Our case is titled \"Two Month's Salary\", leaving a \"normal\" Chicago citizen with a budget of approximately \\&#36;5,795.83 to spend on an engagement ring. Since the data in the dataset does not include decimal places, let's round this down to \\&#36;5,795 as to not go over budget.\n",
