    "Analysts and data scientists spend a considerable amount of time cleaning data. This includes aspects that were covered in <strong>Chapter 12: Analyzing DataFrame Quality</strong>, and extends into the concepts of this chapter. Here, we will expand on our analysis of DataFrame quality from the perspective of missing values. Missing values plague nearly every quantitative analysis, and a vast number of techniques exist in order to address these anomalies. This is a topic worth exploring in immense detail, primarily because:\n",

    "\n",
    "Take, for example, dinosaurs. If you had to draw a picture of your favorite dinosaur, what colors would you use? Odds are you would choose colors such as brown and green. However, any colors you pick would be valid. Given that dinosaurs are extinct, are you absolutely sure that dinosaurs weren't pink or purple? We have no way of knowing with 100% confidence, and our job as analysts is to use available information to make our best guess.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Missing values cause another perplexing challenge:\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><div align=\"center\">\n",
    "<strong>Since we do not know their exact values, we have no way to audit the results of <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/imputed-value.asp\">imputation</a> strategies.</strong>\n",
    "    <a class=\"tocSkip\"></a></div><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "Countless techniques have been developed to address missing values, with the most common presented below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Drop them from the dataset.\n",
    "2. Engineering flag features.\n",
    "3. Impute using a measure of center.\n",
    "4. Develop an algorithm based on available information.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<h4>Dropping Missing Values</h4>\n",
    "Considering that we have no way of knowing what their exact values should be and are unable to audit the results of an imputation strategy, it may seem wise to simply drop missing values from the dataset. Although this seems like a safe bet, <font style=\"color:red\"><strong>this strategy should only be used as a last resort.</strong></font> The following exemplifies the rationale for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><br><div style = \"width:image width px; font-size:80%; text-align:center;\"><img src=\"./__images/chapter-13-diamonds-mv-example.png\" width=\"250\" height=\"200\" style=\"padding-bottom:0.5em;\"> <em>Figure 13.1: Missing value example.</em></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<em>Figure 13.1</em> shows a subset from the <em>diamonds</em> dataset where the values for <em>carat</em> are missing (represented with <em>NaN</em>, which stands for not a number). If missing values were dropped from the dataset, all other information for these observations would also be removed. In other words, we would lose the respective values for <em>price</em>, <em>color</em>, <em>clarity</em>, and <em>cut</em>. Such a practice can cause severe distortions, preventing the data from speaking for itself.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<h4>Engineering Flag Features</h4>\n",
    "<strong>Feature engineering</strong> is the process of developing new features based on discoveries found in the original data. One, often overlooked area of feature engineering is to develop <strong>missing value flags</strong>. Missing value flags are a feature made of ones and zeros, with one representing an original missing value. In other words, a missing value flag is a new column of data based on whether or not the data in an existing column is missing (1 == True, 0 == False). These can be very useful to preserve the integrity of the original dataset and can even be used in predictive modeling. Also, it is important to keep in mind that:\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><div align=\"center\">\n",
    "<strong>The reason behind why a value is missing may be insightful.</strong>\n",
    "    <a class=\"tocSkip\"></a></div><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "A good example comes from an analysis I conducted on a baseball dataset, where several values for the <em>Hit By Pitch</em> column were missing. As its name implies, a <strong>hit by pitch (HBP)</strong> occurs when a batter gets hit by a pitch, resulting in the batter getting a free base. I decided to impute these missing values with the mean or median and move forward with my analysis. Later that evening, I started reading the history of baseball and noticed a pattern to the missing values: In the early days of baseball, a hit by pitch was considered a ball, not a free base. For this reason, HBP was not recorded, leading to missing values. In later years, the HBP rule was implemented, implying that the missing values for this feature represent the transition to a new era of baseball. For this reason, I decided to flag these missing values as they represented a significant event.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "I also discovered that before the HBP rule, baseball was played in a completely different way. For instance, the early days of baseball were much less competitive. Batters would shout out the kind of pitch they wanted and the pitcher would comply. The alleged rationale for this was that fans preferred higher scoring games. Domain knowledge is key, and techniques such as flagging missing values can help make use of domain knowledge.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<h4>Imputing with a Measure of Center</h4>\n",
    "Simply put, when an observation is unknown and there is no other available information, imputing with a measure of center (mean, median, etc.) is our most pragmatic approach, assuming a normal distribution. In such cases, statistics is our best friend. Given enough samples, we will converge on the true value of the population mean. This implies that imputing with a measure of center will result in a minimization of error between the imputation strategy and the true (unknown) value of the missing data. In other words, we will be less wrong if we impute with a measure of center than if we impute with any other value.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<h4>Developing an Algorithm based on Available Information</h4>\n",
    "This strategy becomes more of a focal point after developing a solid understanding of predictive modeling and machine learning. For now, note that given additional information (highly-correlated features, categorical data, etc.), algorithms can be developed to make (potentially) better imputations for missing data. For example, if we were working with country-level data from <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/home\">The World Bank</a> and encountered missing values, we may achieve better results by categorizing countries based on their level of development before imputation.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Additional information on algorithms for missing value imputation can be found in <a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.impute\">Python's official scikit-learn documentation</a>."

Technically speaking, this rule tries to minimize the difference between a feature's theoretical probability distribution and the one observed from the data (i.e., the empirical probability distribution). In other words, this method tries to create an optimal number of bins to fit with the science of statistics as well as the distribution of the phenomenon represented by the data. A lot can occur when this sort of optimization is applied, and sometimes this rule does not work out as well as expected. In most cases, however, it is a good starting point to develop a reasonable visualization for exploratory analysis.
