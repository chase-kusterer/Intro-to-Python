IMPORTANT
---------
The Jupyter Notebooks in this folder are reliant on a hidden images folder.
Moving a notebook out of this folder will result in broken links to all images.
DO NOT MOVE ANY FILES OUT OF THIS FOLDER to prevent this from happening!


BACK UP VERSION
---------------
.pdf versions of this textbook are available in this folder. These are meant to
be a back up version in the event that Jupyter Notebook encounters issues. Note
that the most common issue with the interactive (.ipynb) version of the text is
that Notebook extensions are not configured properly.

IF THIS IS THE CASE, make sure to follow the installation instructions on the
course page as this will also drastically affect your ability to complete
coursework.
